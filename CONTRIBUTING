This is the style guide for code to be included in Bonsai.
Subject to change.

Function declarations should all be on one line, with the opening
curly brace on the next line, like so:

    int foo(void)
    {
            ...
    }

For all other scopes (loops, if statements, etc), the opening curly
braces appears on the same line, like so:

    if (condition) {
        ...
    }

Single line if's and loops should be used when possible, but intelligently.
If a single part of a compound statement (if-else, etc), requires
braces, every other part should use them as well.

variable and function names use lowercase, type names use PascalCase.

if a function's return value is discarded, this should be explicitly
shown by casting the return value to void at the call site, like so:

    int foo(void);

    int main(void)
    {
        int a = foo();
        (void)foo();
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

Try to stay within 80 columns. This is not a strict guideline, but if you notice
you are going over 80 columns, consider refactoring.
